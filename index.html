				Manifesto
			</h2>
			<p class="small">v.1.1 September 29, 2024</p>
			<h3>Traditional trade organizations are dead.</h3>
			<p>
				As an entrepreneur, you‚Äôve probably given your representation to groups
				that still operate like it‚Äôs the early 20th century. Think about your
				local chamber of commerce or business club - when was the last time they
				truly helped you? These organizations are no longer suited for today‚Äôs
				fast-paced world.
			</p>

			<h3>We prefer action.</h3>
			<p>
				The <span>neu Hanse is different - we take a proactive approach</span>.
				With us, you won‚Äôt just adapt to the world around you; you‚Äôll shape and
				improve it.
				<br />
				<br />We start by making it easier for you to connect and trade with
				other entrepreneurs. Then, we work with local officials to ensure they
				understand your needs and challenges.
			</p>
			<h3>We save you time.</h3>
			<p>
				The average business owner works 55-60 hours a week, often more, as you
				probably know. With such a busy schedule, it's hard to find time for
				things like networking events, local meetings, or staying updated on
				regulatory changes. But ignoring these can mean losing your say in
				decisions that affect your business. <br />
				<br />
				By joining neu Hanse, you stay connected,
				<span>without wasting time</span>.
			</p>
			<h3>Connecting and Growing for Impact.</h3>
			<p>
				Private companies like yours provide 30-40% of the state‚Äôs revenue and
				make up 80% of the GDP. The state relies on entrepreneurs like you.
				<br />
				By joining neuHanse, entrepreneurs can become a real force for driving
				growth. We aim to increase your influence and impact, helping your
				efforts benefit everyone. <br />
				<br />
				Join neu Hanse to make this possible. <br />
				Connect, collaborate, and grow with us.
